  <p class="body">Dr. Domenico Lombardo is a physicist and materials engineer in the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR-IPCF) of the Department of Chemical Sciences and Materials Technologies (ITALY). </p>
  <p class="body"> He is performing both experimental and theoretical research in the soft matter, drug delivery and biotechnology fields, in collaboration with the industry, major Italian and European research institutions, and international partners. His research activity is focused on: 
  <ul>
    <li>Experimental and theoretical investigation of the self-assembly (and supramolecular) processes of nanostructured and  hybrid (inorganic-inorganic) bio-materials. </li>
    <li>Study of the soft interaction between nanocarriers and biological (and model) membranes.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p class="body">He is supervisor of a research unit at the CNR-IPCF (Italy), lecturer in several post-graduate courses at University. He has been leading several major research projects that are related to biotechnology, material science and engineering. He has been involved in instrumental development projects within various European laboratories and synchrotron radiation facility (such as Elettra in Trieste-Italy and LURE in Orsay-France). </p> 
  <p class="body">He has been involved in the organization, in the scientific committees and as invited speaker of several workshops, seminars, and national and international conferences. He repeatedly participated at various expert committees at the national and international level. He regularly acts as a consultant, reviewer and editorial board member in various peer-reviewed international scientific journals. He is co-author of over 100 publications (e.g., in peer-reviewed Journals, Conference proceedings, Book chapters). </p>
