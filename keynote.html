  <p class="body">Euverink (1966) holds a position as full professor and is head of the research group “Products and processes for Biotechnology”. He is embedded in the “Engineering and Technology institute Groningen”, at the University of Groningen. From 2004 until 2011 he was program director of Wetsus, European Center of Sustainable Watertechnology in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands. From 1998 until 2004 he started and managed successfully BioExplore, a high throughput screening facility at the department of Microbial Physiology of the Groningen Biomolecular and Biotechnology institute. From 1994 until 1998 he was a post-doc at the Dutch Institute for Carbohydate Research and developed a novel process for the synthesis of a thermoreversible starch derivative. This product is currently produced by Avebe under the brandname Etenia. Euverink received his PhD in microbiology at the University of Groningen in 1995 based upon a study of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism in the methylotrophic actinomycete <i>Amycolatopsis methanolica</i>.</p>
